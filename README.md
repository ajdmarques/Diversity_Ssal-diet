# COI metabarcoding provides insights into the high diverse diet of a generalist salamander, _Salamandra salamandra_

Raw data and R scripts are provided to replicate the results of Marques, AJD; Mata, VA; Velo-Ant√≥n, G. COI metabarcoding provides insights into the high diverse diet of a generalist salamander, _Salamandra salamandra_(Caudata: Salamandridae).2022.Diversity

Users should download the contents of this repository. Open the R project 'DietAnalysis.Rproj' and run the R scripts in order from 01 to 04.
Input data (./input/_primer_/) includes read counts for finalized operational taxonomic units (OTUs) '_primer_.read-count.csv, taxonomic assignments as determined by BOLDIGGER '_primer_.boldigger.csv', and sample information '_primer_.sample-info.csv'. 

Scripts can be found in './R-scripts/' and in order of operation will, 
  01) merge input files from different fragments into a single table and apply filters, 
  02) calculate and generate output figures of sample rarefaction curves for each fagments and region,
  03) compare prey richness between fragments and regions,
  04) build a PerMANOVA model and test for differences between fragments and regions.

Before proceeding, ensure the following packages have been installed.

install.packages(c('dplyr','tidyverse','iNEXT','vegan','magrittr','ggplot2'))
